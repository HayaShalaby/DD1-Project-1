This is a Logic Cicuits Simulator, and the way it works is by receiving 3 input files that specify the gate functions, the circuit and the stimulus and produces an output file that represents the expected output of the ciruit. 
This repository will contain: the source code, input files (including test files), expected output and the actual output of the program, as well as visualizations for the test circuits, and finally, the report.
