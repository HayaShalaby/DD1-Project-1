This is a Logic Circuits Simulator.



In order to run this application, you will be propmted to input the paths to 5 files, namely:
-Library File (.lib)
-Circuit File (.cir)
-Stimuli File (.stim)
as inputs to the program, as well as the paths for the program to output the:
-Simulation File (.sim)
-JSON File (.jsom)

The simulation files is a log that details the changes that take place in the circuit, identified by the time the change took place, the signal name and the value it changed to.

The JSON file is an alternative form of the simulation file that can be used in the WaveDrom website to visualize the output of the circuit.





This repository contains: the algorithm outline, the source code, input files (including test files), the expected output and the actual output of the program, as well as visualizations for the test circuits, and finally, the report.
